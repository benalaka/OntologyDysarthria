# An Ontology Learning Model for Dysarthria Speech Using Semantic-Situational Projection Analysis
This study uses emotional dialogue acts of Dysarthric speech to first of all perform triple completion through a situational semantic projection model. Speech patterns such as pitch, volume and vowel in time are thereafter incorporated into the the ontologies created to perform link prediction (Ontology Learning) for purposes of enriching Listener remediation
